        "This exploratory data analysis(EDA) project focuses on analyzing the Hotel Booking dataset. This hotel booking dataset contain booking information for city hotel and resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, chieldren and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.\n",
        "\n",
        "It consists of 1,19,390 observations and 31 variables. Each observation represents a hotel booking. The dataset comprehense bookings arrive between the 1st of July of 2015 and 31st of August 2017, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were cancelled.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our analysis can help us understand about the given dataset and draw some useful insights to make some crucial business decisions regarding the factors affecting the bookings of the hotels. In hotel industry, cancellations and average daily rate are two important factors that effects the business.\n",
        "\n",
        "By understanding the factors that are determining the cancellation of certain bookings, the hotels can take necessary precautions to reduce cancellation rate.\n",

        "Our goal here is to understand such factors in the given data by performing exploratory data analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data, so as to discover patterns, to spot anomalies to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations\n",

        "**Data preparation:** Firstly, we imported libraries and dataset, some of the libraries used are NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn. Once dataset and libraries are imported, process of analysis begins. But data have to be translated in an appropriate form. This process is known as data preparation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Cleaning:** The raw data received in the data received in the data set might not be directly suitable for analysis due to presence of unwanted data like, duplicate values, null values, outliers etc. We need to handle them first before we proceed with further analysis.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Univariate Analysis:** Choose a single feature from the data and try to determine what the output or target value is, i.e. one features/variable at a time.\n",
        "* Understand the trends and patterns of data.\n",
        "* Analyze the frequency and other such characteristics of data.\n",
        "* Know the distribution of the variables in the data.\n",
        "* Visualise the relationship that may exist between different variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bivariate Analysis:** We try to analyze two features instead of one, and finally determine the classification of output we are looking for. It is a methodical statistical technique applied to a pair of variables of data to determine the empirical relationship between them. In  order words, it is meant to determine any concurrent relations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Multivariate Analysis: We analyze three or more different features at a time, to understand the relationship between all the features involved.\n",

Based on findings, we recommand the hotels to implement necessary steps and plans to improve the marketing strategy."
